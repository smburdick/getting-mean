# Sam Burdick - Completed through Ch. 4 of Getting MEAN

[Online heroku app](https://stormy-everglades-97873.herokuapp.com/)  
I originally had some problems getting the app on to Heroku due to an error in the application pathway. Other
than that, everything went smoothly.
(Completed through Ch. 3)

Completed through Chapter 4 of Getting MEAN: Other than some minor typing issues everything felt fine. One typo I noticed firsthand was on line 25 of locations-list.jade: there is a pipe that is not supposed to be there that will cause the front page details of the restaurants to render incorrectly, though this problem was mainly a cosmetic one.
Also, on line 1 of layout.jade, "doctype 5" should be "doctype html" (the book's code is for a deprecated version of jade)
